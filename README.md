# Example matching calculation
def calculate_match_score(student, scholarship):
    score = 0
    
    # Location matching (30%)
    if student.county in scholarship.target_counties:
        score += 30
    
    # Education level (25%)
    if student.education_level in scholarship.target_education_levels:
        score += 25
    
    # GPA requirements (20%)
    if student.gpa >= scholarship.minimum_gpa:
        score += 20
    
    # Additional criteria (25%)
    # Age, income, special requirements, etc.
    
    return min(score, 100)  # Cap at 100%
```

## üöÄ Deployment Guide for Render

### Quick Deploy to Render (Recommended)

Follow these steps for a fast and clean deployment to Render:

#### Step 1: Pre-deployment Setup

1. **Ensure all files are ready:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd tuvuke_hub
   
   # Check that all deployment files exist
   ls build.sh render.yaml tuvuke_hub/settings_prod.py
   ```

2. **Make build script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x build.sh
   ```

3. **Test locally (Optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Install production dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Test production settings
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tuvuke_hub.settings_prod
   export SECRET_KEY=test-key-for-local-testing
   export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
   export DEBUG=False
   
   python manage.py check --deploy
   ```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Render

##### Option A: Using render.yaml (Automated - Fastest)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to Render: Add production configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render:**
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Click "New" ‚Üí "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the `render.yaml` file
   - Click "Apply"

##### Option B: Manual Setup (More Control)

1. **Create PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Click "New" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
   - Settings:
     - **Name**: `tuvuke-hub-db`
     - **Database**: `tuvuke_hub`
     - **User**: `admin`
     - **Plan**: Free (or paid for production)
   - Click "Create Database"
   - **Copy the External Database URL**

2. **Create Web Service:**
   - Click "New" ‚Üí "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Settings:
     - **Name**: `tuvuke-hub`
     - **Environment**: `Python 3`
     - **Build Command**: `chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh`
     - **Start Command**: `gunicorn tuvuke_hub.wsgi:application`
     - **Plan**: Free (or paid for production)

3. **Environment Variables:**
   ```env
   DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tuvuke_hub.settings_prod
   SECRET_KEY=[Generate a strong secret key]
   DATABASE_URL=[Paste the PostgreSQL URL from step 1]
   DEBUG=False
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app-name.onrender.com,.onrender.com
   PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
   ```

#### Step 3: Post-Deployment Configuration

1. **Create Superuser:**
   - Go to your web service dashboard
   - Click "Shell" tab
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

2. **Load Initial Data (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Load counties data
   python manage.py loaddata counties.json
   
   # Load sample scholarships (if you have fixtures)
   python manage.py loaddata sample_scholarships.json
   ```

3. **Test the Deployment:**
   - Visit your app: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
   - Test key features:
     - Homepage loads
     - User registration works
     - Admin panel accessible: `/admin/`
     - Health check: `/health/`

### Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | Django settings module | `tuvuke_hub.settings_prod` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Django secret key | `your-secret-key-here` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql://user:pass@host/db` |
| `DEBUG` | Debug mode (always False in production) | `False` |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Allowed hostnames | `your-app.onrender.com,.onrender.com` |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | Email service username (optional) | `your-email@gmail.com` |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | Email service password (optional) | `your-app-password` |

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Build Failures
- **Python version issues**: Ensure `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11` is set
- **Dependency conflicts**: Check `requirements.txt` for version conflicts
- **Permission denied**: Ensure `build.sh` is executable with `chmod +x build.sh`

#### Database Issues
- **Connection refused**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set
- **Migration errors**: Check that migrations are up to date locally first
- **Permission denied**: Ensure database user has proper permissions

#### Static Files Not Loading
- **WhiteNoise not working**: Verify it's in `MIDDLEWARE` in settings
- **Missing collectstatic**: Ensure `build.sh` runs `collectstatic`
- **Wrong static URL**: Check `STATIC_URL` and `STATIC_ROOT` settings

#### SSL/HTTPS Issues
- **Mixed content**: Ensure all resources use HTTPS in production
- **Redirect loops**: Check `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` setting
- **Certificate issues**: Render handles SSL automatically

### Performance Optimization

1. **Database Optimization:**
   - Use connection pooling with `conn_max_age=600`
   - Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` for complex queries

2. **Static Files:**
   - Enable compression with WhiteNoise
   - Use CDN for media files in production
   - Optimize images and CSS/JS files

3. **Caching:**
   - Enable database caching for session storage
   - Cache expensive database queries
   - Use Redis for advanced caching (paid plans)

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Health Monitoring:**
   - Health check endpoint: `/health/`
   - Monitor application logs in Render dashboard
   - Set up alerting for downtime

2. **Database Maintenance:**
   - Regular backups (automatic on paid plans)
   - Monitor database size and performance
   - Clean up old sessions and logs periodically

3. **Updates and Deployments:**
   - Use Git branches for feature development
   - Test changes locally before deployment
   - Use Render's preview deployments for testing

### Cost Optimization

1. **Free Tier Limitations:**
   - Services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - 750 hours per month limit
   - Limited bandwidth and storage

2. **Upgrade Considerations:**
   - **Starter ($7/month)**: No sleeping, more bandwidth
   - **Standard ($25/month)**: Better performance, more resources
   - **Pro ($85/month)**: High availability, advanced features

### Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Never commit secrets to Git
   - Use strong, unique secret keys
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Django Security:**
   - Keep Django and dependencies updated
   - Use HTTPS everywhere (`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True`)
   - Enable security headers

3. **Database Security:**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Limit database access to your application
   - Regular security updates

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] `build.sh` is executable
- [ ] `requirements.txt` includes all production dependencies
- [ ] `settings_prod.py` is configured correctly
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Render
- [ ] Database is created and connected
- [ ] Static files are configured with WhiteNoise
- [ ] Health check endpoint is working
- [ ] Superuser account is created
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS is working
- [ ] All key features are tested

### Expected Deployment Time

- **Preparation**: 15-20 minutes
- **Render Setup**: 10-15 minutes
- **Build and Deploy**: 5-10 minutes
- **Testing and Configuration**: 10-15 minutes

**Total**: ~40-60 minutes for complete deployment
